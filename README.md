# AuthEcho_Project

This project contains well-trained deep learning models to predict the **Speaker** and their **Gender**.

The repository offers a **Speaker and Gender Prediction System** built using **TensorFlow**, **Librosa**, and **Gradio**. The application predicts the top 3 speakers and their probabilities from an audio file, determines the speaker's gender, and classifies unknown speakers using a confidence threshold.

## Features

- **Top 3 Speakers**: Predicts the top 3 speakers from an audio file.
- **Gender Prediction**: Determines the gender of the speaker.
- **Unknown Detection**: Identifies unknown speakers with a confidence threshold.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a Gradio interface for easy testing.
